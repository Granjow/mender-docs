After [building a Mender Yocto Project image](../../05.System-updates-Yocto-Project/03.Build-for-demo/docs.md#building-the-image), you need to write the disk
image to the flash of the device. There are two ways to accomplish that:

1. Write the image to the storage directly
2. Boot from removable media and flash the image from there

Depending on the build configuration the disk image will have one of the
following suffixes: `sdimg`, `uefiimg`, `biosimg`, or `gptimg`. All disk images
are created by the `meta-mender` layer and by default contain four partitions
(boot, 2Ã— rootfs, data). They are meant to be written directly to the device
storage.

Additionally, a `hddimg` image with a live installer is built if `meta-mender`
builds one of the above image types.

If the image is compressed, you first need to decompress it first with one of
the commands below:

```bash
# For gz compressed images.
gunzip <IMAGE-NAME>.img.gz

# For xz compressed images.
unxz <IMAGE-NAME>.img.xz

# For zip compressed images.
unzip <IMAGE-NAME>.img.zip
```

## Example: Provisioning a SD card based device

This example applies to e.g. a Raspberry Pi.


### Pre-requisite: A physical device to provision that uses SD cards

In this initial provisioning you will flash and overwrite everything
on the given device storage.

There are several methods to flash storage, and the simplest case is if your
device uses a SD card. We will make this assumption here, but you can use the
same disk image for flashing any block device. See [Flash memory
types](../../05.System-updates-Yocto-Project/02.Board-integration/01.Partition-configuration/docs.md#flash-memory-types) 
for the definition of block device used here.



### Write the disk image to the SD card

!! Be careful! If you point to the wrong `<DEVICE>` when executing the command below, you risk overwriting your workstation's local or connected storage devices.

Assuming you are in the same directory as your disk image, you can write it to
the the SD card using the following command (`sdimg` is used as an example):

```bash
sudo dd if=<PATH-TO-IMAGE>.sdimg of=<DEVICE> bs=1M && sudo sync
```

Or, using [bmaptool](https://github.com/intel/bmap-tools):

```bash
sudo bmaptool copy --nobmap <PATH-TO-IMAGE.sdimg> <DEVICE>
```

This may take a few minutes, depending on the size of the image.

!!! &lt;DEVICE&gt; depends on what device name the Operating System assign to
!!! your SD-card. Normally, on Linux, the device is usually on the form
!!! `/dev/mmcblk[0-9]` or `/dev/sd[a-z]`. If you are unsure how to
!!! find the correct device, the Raspberry Pi Foundation provides some nice
!!! references that can help you for
!!! [Linux](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/linux.md?target=_blank),
!!! [Mac OSX](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/mac.md?target=_blank),
!!! [Windows](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/windows.md?target=_blank).


## Example: Provision a device with a live USB stick

In this example you will create a bootable USB stick and use the live installer
to write the image to the device.

Write the `.hddimg` file to a USB stick following the steps of the previous
example. Note that everything on that USB stick will be erased.

Then boot from the USB stick on the target device and select the installer in
the boot menu. This will then write the image from the USB stick to the device.
